This study aims to explore the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in pre-
dicting lithium content within geological samples. An evolving modeling baseline was
employed to incorporate successive key findings, offering an enhanced platform for
analysis and future research. We inspected a geochemical dataset, identifying KNN
as the superior imputation method based on Missing At Random (MAR) data. Fur-
ther analysis, including EDA and feature engineering, revealed skewed distributions
in major and trace elements. Four machine learning models were assessed across
different normalization techniques, with square root normalization and the XGBoost
gradient boosting model delivering the superior performance. The study outlines its
limitations and future research directions, intending to both contribute to the field
and inform subsequent investigations.
